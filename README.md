# Jancy Example Proxy Provider

## Structure of the Plug-in
- `example-proxy-provider/package.json` - A simple file that describes the plugin to Jancy and specifies an entry point. `src/index.js` in this example.
- `example-proxy-provider/src/index.js` - This is the main file that implements most of our plugins logic. The most important part is the object exported that has a couple of very specific jancy properties and functions (jancy_props, jancy_onInit, jancy_onEnabled, jancy_onDisabled). That's probably where you should start

## Adding the Plug-in to Jancy

1. Open the Jancy plug-in folder
    - On Windows, open Windows File Explorer and go to %appdata%\Jancy\plugins or on MacOS
    - On MacOS, open Finder and go to `~/Library/Application Support/Jancy/plugins`
2. Copy `example-proxy-provider` folder to the plug-ins folder from step 1.
3. Restart Jancy if it's already running.
4. If everything works correctly you should see the example plugin in the list of plugins in `File -> Settings -> Plugins`.
5. Go to the Proxy settings panel (`File -> Setting -> Proxies`)
6. Click the + button and select the "Load proxies from our fictitious API" option
7. In the dialog that appears type in a URL and a Name. You can make these values up. They're aren't used for anything important.
8. Press the "Add" button.
9. If all works correctly, you should see an entry for the provider instance you just created and it should say "2 proxies loaded"
